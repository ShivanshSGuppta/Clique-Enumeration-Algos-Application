#  Question3

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and experimenting with maximal clique enumeration algorithms in C++. The objective is to identify all maximal cliques in a given graph dataset and analyze the performance in terms of execution time and clique size distribution.

## File Description
- **demo2.cpp**: The main C++ source file containing the implementation of the maximal clique enumeration algorithm.

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard Template Library (STL)

### Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o clique_enum demo2.cpp
```

### Execution
To run the program, provide a graph input file as an argument:
```bash
./clique_enum <graph_file>
```
Example:
```bash
./clique_enum sample_graph.txt
```

## Input File Format
- The input file should contain edges of the graph in the format:
```
u v
```
Where `u` and `v` represent connected vertices. Commented lines starting with `#` are ignored.

## Output Description
- **Total Cliques**: The number of maximal cliques found.
- **Max Clique Size**: The size of the largest clique identified.
- **Clique Size Distribution**: The number of cliques of each size.
- **Elapsed Time**: The time taken to complete the enumeration.

## Performance Analysis
The program measures the performance based on:
- Execution time using `std::chrono`.
- Distribution of clique sizes.

## Graph Datasets
The experiment is designed to run on multiple graph datasets with varying densities and sizes to assess the scalability and efficiency of the implementation.

## Results and Discussion
This section will include:
- Analysis of execution time across different datasets.
- Insights on how clique sizes distribute in sparse vs. dense graphs.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how maximal clique enumeration behaves under different graph structures, offering insights into its computational complexity and performance bottlenecks.
